# Developing a Machine Learning model using different algorithms to predict shot success rate on the Kobe Bryant shot selection dataset 

### This report presents a predictive modeling approach for determining the success or failure of shots made by Kobe Bryant during his NBA career using various machine learning algorithms. The main stages in this research include data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, selecting relevant features, and finally, implementing different algorithms on this binary
experiment. The performance of each algorithm is evaluated, and as the final step, a  voting ensemble approach is explored to improve model accuracy.
