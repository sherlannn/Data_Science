# Ethereum Price Prediction Using Neural Networks  

This project leverages seven different neural network models to predict Ethereum (ETH) prices based on historical market data. The goal is to explore the predictive capabilities of neural networks in the highly dynamic and volatile cryptocurrency market.  

## ðŸŒŸ Features  
- **7 Neural Network Architectures**: Compare the performance of multiple NNs.  
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.  
- **Visualization**: Interactive plots and graphs to compare predictions with actual prices.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned and normalized historical Ethereum price data.  
   - Used features like open, high, low, close, and volume.  

2. **Neural Network Models**  
   - Implemented and compared seven NN architectures:  
     - MLP  
     - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)  
     - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  
     - Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)  
     - FeedForward Network (FFN) 
     - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
     - dilated CNN  

3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score.  

4. **Results**  
   - Detailed analysis of each model's performance.  
   - Insights into the advantages and trade-offs of different architectures.
